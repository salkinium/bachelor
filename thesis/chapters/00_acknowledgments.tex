\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I want to thank my advisors Matteo and Florian for their time and support.
Our discussions kept me focused on what was important and constantly pushed me towards improving the experiments and evaluations.

Many thanks go to my supervisor Prof. Dr.-Ing. Klaus Wehrle and to my second supervisor Prof. Dr. Rumpe.
