\chapter{Testbed Description}
\label{chap:testbed}

In order to be able to investigate the effects of temperature on our \ac{WSN} motes, we built a new low-cost testbed, which can accurately control mote temperature and allows the mote to maintain a certain antenna position.
Furthermore, we wrote flexible control and evaluation software, which orchestrates the experiments and logs all relevant data to disk.
In this chapter we will describe the design decisions we made and how they influence the testbed performance.
