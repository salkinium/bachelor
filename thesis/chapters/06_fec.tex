\chapter{\acl{FEC}}
\label{chap:forward_error_correction}

In the last chapters, we described the effect of temperature on \ac{BER} patterns and \ac{PRR}, without drafting any specific recommendations how to improve this loss of link quality.
\ac{FEC} is a well known technique to improve throughput in links of poor quality, however, once a \ac{ECC} and its parameters have been chosen, usually they remain static and do not change over time.
This means that for links where the quality is not stable over time, as in \acp{WSN}, the chosen \ac{ECC} incurs unneeded overhead in links with overal good link quality, and underperforms in links with poor quality.

We therefore wanted to investigate how using temperature as an indicator for adapting \ac{ECC} parameter can benefit \ac{PRR} and throughput and what improvements and limitations to expect.
In doing so, we are moving away from a macro-view of all influences on link quality to focus on the impact of temperature on \ac{FEC} on \emph{one} link at a time.

We extended the control software described in Section~\ref{sec:control_software} to encode messages to be sent and to decode received messages with an \ac{FEC} scheme.
The messages are logged in the same format, with the additional information of the FEC scheme and coding strength.
This allows us to reuse our existing evaluation software to easily map error-free \ac{PRR} to \emph{decoded} error-free \ac{PRR}.
