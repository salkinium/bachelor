\chapter{Testbed Description}

In all our experiments we used Tmote Sky motes, which are commercial drop-in replacements for the original Telos mote designed by Polastre~\etal~\cite{Polastre2005}.
We had hardware revisions available from two manufacturers: the original design from (now defunct) MoteIV Corporation and the Maxfor MTM-CM5000MSP.
All motes are powered by the on-board voltage regulator via the USB connector, which is also used to establish serial communications with the PC.

Here we will describe our testbed design and measure its performance.
